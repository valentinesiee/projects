To achieve the project's objectives, I employed a combination of Named Entity Recognition (NER) and LLM techniques. Initially, I experimented with these methods separately, each exhibiting its own set of advantages and disadvantages. After thorough assessment, I concluded that integrating both approaches would yield optimal results by capitalizing on their respective strengths.

In the combined approach, I utilized multiple Bert NER models, each responsible for tokenizing the text and classifying specific instances. These models acted as filters, specializing in the classification of precise entities. Through iterative processes, I obtained the pseudonymized text, which was then passed with the IDs/Names dictionnary, the problems/diseases, treatments to a LLM . The LLM was tasked with scrutinizing the text for any discrepancies or issues and correcting them as necessary. This collaborative workflow ensured a robust and accurate pseudonymization process, mitigating the risk of inadvertently exposing sensitive information while maintaining the integrity and coherence of the medical reports.
