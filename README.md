# Projects

Here are some of my projects I mainly did during internship.

ChatURL : 
A StreamLit application where you can enter any website's URL and get a summary of it. This is done by doing RAG and using a LLM. 

ChatPDF :
A StreamLit application where you can upload any PDF and get a summary of it. This is done by doing RAG and unsing a LLM.

Medical Reports Pseudonymisation : 
The main project I worked on during an internship involved pseudonymizing medical reports. The purpose was to conceal private information such as the patient's name or date of birth, which doctors typically include in their reports. The goal was to generate an ID for each patient and replace all instances of the patient's name in the text with this ID. One of the challenges was ensuring that the replacement process didn't inadvertently affect names of places, such as hospitals or addresses. Once the dictionary associating IDs with patient names was created, it would be used exclusively by the hospital to identify the patient associated with each report.
Additionaly the goal is also to hide the date of birth and also to make sure other dates are not hide.
This project was done by combining the use of NER and LLM.
